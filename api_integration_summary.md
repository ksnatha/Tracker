# API Integration Strategy for Multiple Applications

## Executive Summary

We need to share API data with approximately 10 downstream applications. Each application requires different subsets of data with some overlap. This document outlines three integration approaches with recommendations.

---

## Context

**Challenge:** 
- 10+ downstream applications need data from our API
- Each app needs different information (basic + app-specific)
- Significant overlap in data requirements across apps
- Quick delivery is a key constraint

**Domain Groups:**
- User
- Billing  
- Permissions
- Inventory
- Analytics

---

## Option 1: Pull-Based API with Filtering

### Overview
Applications call our API on-demand using query parameters to specify which domain groups they need.

### How It Works
```
GET /api/data?groups=user,billing
GET /api/data?groups=user,permissions
GET /api/data (returns all groups)
```

### Pros
- **Simple to implement** - Single API endpoint, straightforward logic, no complex infrastructure
- **Fast time to delivery** - Can be built and deployed quickly with existing tools
- **Stateless architecture** - No need to track subscriptions or maintain state
- **Consumer control** - Applications decide what data they need and when
- **Easy to test and debug** - Standard HTTP requests, familiar patterns

### Cons
- **Polling overhead** - Apps must repeatedly call API to get fresh data
- **Network latency** - Data only as fresh as last API call
- **Potential over-fetching** - Apps might request more than they immediately need
- **Load on API** - High polling frequency can strain resources
- **No proactive notifications** - Apps won't know about changes until they check

### Best For
- Applications with user-triggered actions
- Near real-time requirements acceptable
- Small to medium team with limited infrastructure
- Quick delivery timeline (recommended for Phase 1)

---

## Option 2: Push-Based with Webhooks

### Overview
Our system proactively pushes data to registered application webhooks when events occur or data changes.

### How It Works
```
Event occurs → System identifies subscribers → 
Pushes filtered data to each app's webhook URL
```

Each app registers:
- Webhook URL
- Desired domain groups
- Event types to subscribe to

### Pros
- **Real-time delivery** - Apps receive updates immediately when changes occur
- **Reduced API load** - No polling needed, system pushes only when necessary
- **Event-driven architecture** - Clean separation of concerns, scalable pattern
- **Bandwidth efficient** - Only send data when it changes
- **Proactive notifications** - Apps don't need to check for updates

### Cons
- **Complex delivery management** - Must handle retries, failures, dead letter queues
- **Subscriber registry required** - Need to maintain app registrations and configurations
- **Delivery guarantees challenging** - What if app is down? Network fails? Need robust retry logic
- **Higher operational overhead** - Monitoring, alerting, debugging distributed deliveries
- **Security complexity** - Webhook signature verification, secrets management

### Best For
- Critical real-time requirements
- Event-driven workflows
- Applications that need immediate notifications
- Teams with infrastructure/DevOps resources
- Phase 2 or 3 implementation after pull API is stable

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Pull + Selective Push)

### Overview
Combine pull-based API for on-demand access with push webhooks for critical, time-sensitive events only.

### How It Works
```
Normal flow: Apps call API with filtering when needed
Critical events: System pushes to webhooks immediately

Examples:
- Pull: User profile updates, billing info, routine data
- Push: Payment failures, security alerts, account suspensions
```

### Pros
- **Best of both worlds** - On-demand access + real-time for critical events
- **Manageable complexity** - Push only for 3-5 critical events, not everything
- **Gradual adoption** - Start with pull, add push incrementally
- **Optimal resource usage** - Push where it matters, pull for routine needs
- **Flexible evolution** - Can expand push coverage based on actual needs

### Cons
- **Two integration patterns** - Apps must implement both pull and push endpoints
- **Split logic** - Need to decide what's pull vs push for each use case
- **Increased documentation** - Must explain when to use which approach
- **Higher initial setup** - More moving parts than pure pull or pure push
- **Partial complexity** - Still need webhook infrastructure even if limited

### Best For
- Organizations wanting to balance simplicity and real-time needs
- Phased rollout strategy
- Mixed application requirements
- Long-term scalable solution

## Recommendation

### Phase 1: Pull-Based API with Filtering (Immediate - 2-3 weeks)
**Start here for quick delivery:**
- Implement single API endpoint with domain group filtering
- Source-centric grouping (user, billing, permissions, inventory, analytics)
- Simple query parameter: `?groups=user,billing`
- Full response if no filter specified

**Deliverables:**
- REST API with filtering logic
- Documentation showing recommended groups per app
- Basic monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Add Selective Push (Future - 1-2 months)
**Add webhooks for critical events only:**
- Identify 3-5 truly time-sensitive events
- Implement webhook delivery system
- Maintain pull API for routine access

**Examples of push-worthy events:**
- payment.failed
- account.suspended  
- security.alert
- inventory.critical_low

### Phase 3: Expand Based on Usage (6+ months)
**Evaluate and adjust:**
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Identify high-frequency polling
- Convert appropriate scenarios to push
- Keep pull for everything else

## Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | Pull + Filter | Push (Webhooks) | Hybrid |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Time to Deliver** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Fast | ⭐⭐ Slow | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Real-time Data** | ⭐⭐ Polling delay | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Immediate | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Selective |
| **Complexity** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Simple | ⭐⭐ Complex | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate |
| **API Load** | ⭐⭐ High polling | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Minimal | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Optimized |
| **Operational Overhead** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Minimal | ⭐⭐ Significant | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate |
| **Scalability** | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good |

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Source-Centric Grouping (Recommended)
**Group by domain, not by application:**
- ✅ Groups: `user`, `billing`, `permissions`, `inventory`, `analytics`
- ❌ Not: `mobileApp`, `webDashboard`, `reportingTool`

**Rationale:**
- No field duplication across groups
- Stable API contract independent of consumer changes
- Logical data cohesion
- Easy maintenance and documentation

### 2. Filtering Mechanism
**Query parameter based:**
```
GET /api/data?groups=user,billing,permissions
```

**Response structure:**
```json
{
  "user": { all user fields },
  "billing": { all billing fields },
  "permissions": { all permissions fields }
}
```

### 3. Default Behavior
- No filter = return all groups
- Invalid group name = ignore gracefully or return error
- Empty groups parameter = return all groups

---

## Implementation Considerations

### Pull API Requirements
- Standard REST endpoint
- Query parameter parsing and validation
- Response filtering logic
- Error handling for invalid groups
- API documentation for consumers

### Push Webhook Requirements (Phase 2)
- Subscriber registration system
- Event detection and routing
- Webhook delivery engine with retries
- Dead letter queue for failures
- Webhook signature verification
- Monitoring and alerting

### Documentation Needs
- API endpoint specification
- Available domain groups and their fields
- Example requests and responses
- Recommended groups per application type
- Rate limiting and usage guidelines

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Pull API)
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- All 10 apps successfully integrated
- Average payload size reduction of 40-60% with filtering

### Phase 2 (Selective Push)
- Webhook delivery success rate > 99%
- Event delivery latency < 5 seconds
- Zero data loss for critical events
- Reduction in polling frequency for apps using webhooks

---

## Conclusion

**Immediate Action:** Implement Pull-Based API with domain-centric filtering for fastest time to delivery.

**Future Evolution:** Selectively add push capabilities for time-critical events once pull API is stable and usage patterns are understood.

This phased approach balances quick delivery with long-term scalability and maintainability.
